<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my first project in my life. I came up with the idea to make my system "Viewed-Scheduled-Completed-Likes-Discarded". And I started implementing it! Now there are two versions, one for working with text files, the other [for working with DataBase](https://github.com/ThNikGhost/The-system--V-P-C-L-D-work-with-DataBase)
We plan to make a GUI version and a website version so that you can conveniently view and edit lists from any device!

Everything should work like this, let's say you have a list of movies you've watched and a list of movies you'd like to watch.
In the evening, you and your family watched the movie "The Godfather" and decided to mark it.
Log in to the app and go to the list of movies you wanted to watch. There you search for "The Godfather" and mark it as "Viewed", confirm your actions and voila!
"The Godfather" is now in the list of movies you've watched
